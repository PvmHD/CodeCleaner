# CodeCleaner
With this tool you will be able to format JavaScript code in a click. Packers and compressed JavaScript are supported and can be cleaned.

You can choose what kind of indentation you need (tab, 2/3/4 spaces, â€¦).
Also, a lot of options are available.

HTML and CSS are supported too, but I will make some improvements in future updates.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
